/**
 * Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 *
 * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
 * Output: 2
